Prepared by Allison Horst

### Objectives:

- Count categorical data by groups (`dplyr::count()`, `dplyr::tally()`, `dplyr::n()`)
- Uncount a frequency table (`dplyr::uncount()`)
- Parse dates with `lubridate`
- Meet the `t.test()` function

### Data: SBC LTER lobster abundance

**Overview:** "Data on abundance, size and fishing pressure of California spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus) are collected along the mainland coast of the Santa Barbara Channel. Spiny lobsters are an important predator in giant kelp forests off southern California. Two SBC LTER study reefs are located in or near the California Fish and Game Network of Marine Protected Areas (MPA), Naples and Isla Vista, both established as MPAs on 2012-01-01."
